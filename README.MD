# Assets

Assets are stored in the assets folder and are managed with **git LFS**.

## Installation of git LFS

To install the assets, run `git lfs install` in the terminal. This will download the assets from the repository.

To update the assets, run `git lfs pull` in the terminal.

To add new assets, add them to the assets folder and run `git add assets/*` to add them to the repository. Then run `git lfs track "assets/*"` to enable git LFS for the new assets. Finally, run `git add .gitattributes` to add the new assets to the repository.

Then push your changes with `git push`.
