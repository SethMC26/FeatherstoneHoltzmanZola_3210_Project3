# Deploy branch

This is my deploy branch there are many like it but this one is mine. My deploy branch is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. My Deploy branch, without me, is useless. Without my Deploy Branch, I am useless. I must deploy my branch true.

*Note for Stuetzle this branch is not for grading only deployment to firebase and github pages*
